# MARC Pandas
This project contains transformers for [MARC 21 metadata](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/) for NLP applications.
Transformers output [Pandas data frames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas-dataframe) for downstream processing.

## Usage

```python
from marc_pandas import (load, transform, marc, transformers, corpora)

marc = load('marc.xml', fields = [marc.MainEntry, marc.Title, marc.Edition])
vectorized = transform(marc, transformer = transformers.NGrams(1), corpus = corpora.LOC2014)
```

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are encouraged.

Some project ideas:
- Transformations based on text embeddings (Word2Vec, Glove, etc).
- A bag-of-words corpus built on the Library of Congress 2014 dataset.
